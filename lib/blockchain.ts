// No code to modify, the existing code is assumed to be correct and the updates indicate undeclared variables.
// Assuming the variables are part of a testing framework like Jest or Mocha, we can add a comment to indicate this.
// If they are meant to be part of the blockchain logic, further information is needed to determine their purpose and how to declare/import them.

// Assuming 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and' are part of a testing framework:
// These variables are likely provided by a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.
// If this code is part of a test suite, ensure the testing framework is properly configured.

// Assuming 'brevity' is a variable that should be declared:
// const brevity = someValue; // Replace someValue with the appropriate value or import.

// If the variables are not part of a testing framework and are required for the blockchain logic,
// please provide more context so that I can properly declare or import them.
