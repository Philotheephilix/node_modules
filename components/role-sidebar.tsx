// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within a test suite context (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
// Therefore, I will add a comment indicating that these variables are likely provided by the test environment.
// Without the original code, I cannot provide a more specific solution.

// Assuming 'brevity', 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and' are part of a testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha)
// and are implicitly available in the test environment.

// Example usage (replace with actual code from components/role-sidebar.tsx if available):
// it('should render correctly', () => {
//   expect(is).toBe(correct);
//   and(brevity, is);
// });

// Rest of the original components/role-sidebar.tsx code would go here.
// No actual code changes are made because the original file content is unavailable.
