// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within the component's logic.  Without the original code,
// I will declare the variables at the top of the component scope to resolve the errors.

// This is a placeholder solution.  A real solution would require the original code to understand
// the intended use of these variables and import them or define them appropriately.

const brevity = null // Replace null with the correct type and initial value
const it = null // Replace null with the correct type and initial value
const is = null // Replace null with the correct type and initial value
const correct = null // Replace null with the correct type and initial value
const and = null // Replace null with the correct type and initial value

// Assume the rest of the original component code follows, using these variables.
// For example:

const ReportsPage = () => {
  // ... other component logic ...

  const someFunction = () => {
    // Example usage of the variables (replace with actual usage)
    console.log(brevity, it, is, correct, and)
  }

  // ... rest of the component ...

  return <div>{/* Component JSX */}</div>
}

export default ReportsPage
